\section{Topology}
We used a total of 6 stages in our amplifier. Five common sources and one source follower.
Our first decision was to choose topologies to use for amplification. We first considered using a cascode stage because of its characteristically high gain and good frequency response (high bandwidth). However, due to the high gain of the cascode  After some more consideration, we decided to use multiple stages of common source topologies because they would be much easier to bias than cascode stage. We also decided to use MOSFETS rather
than BJTs because while they had lower gain than BJTs, the infinite gate impedance proved more attractive. As for the specific devices, we used the 
BS170 N-channel MOSFETs because they had the highest gain of all the MOSFETS given to us.
